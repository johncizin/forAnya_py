# Quick Description:
- File: <a href = "https://github.com/johncizin/forAnya_py/blob/main/src/basicNotion.py"> basicNotion.py </a>
    - This file reads the data from a table created in the file. It simulates and API call from your computer to Notion's computer. **Notion is simply the example but all applications have an API (Application Programming Interface) that allows it to talk to other programs, while encapsulating its own data.**
- File: anotherNotion_json.py
    - This python file reads data from an existing JSON file included in this repo. **JSON (JavaScript Object Notion) is a human-readable text format commonly used when exhanging data, e.g. calling an API it returns a JSON formatted data. Just think of it as a specific language that some API's use to talk to each other.**
